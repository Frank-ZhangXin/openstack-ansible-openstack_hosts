# NOTE(hwoarang) snapper make take significant amount of CPU time
# when executing zypper over and over so it's best to disable the
# background comparison process. Snapper may need further tuning
# for example reducing the number of snapshots to keep, disable daily
# cleanup job etc but these may come later in the future if needed.
